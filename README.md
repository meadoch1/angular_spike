angular_spike
=============

A spike of using AngularJS with Rails 3.2.16.

This work was created to spike out the use and behavior of AngularJS.  As such it does not contain "production quality" code.  For instance, unit tests and error handling have not been implemented.

The code in this repository was written following many AngularJS best practices for building larger scale applications and thus shows some more of AngularJS's capabilities and features than many tutorial applications.  For instance, classes are contained in separate files and in many cases separate modules.

At the time of writing I would certainly not call myself an AngularJS "expert".  Thus there is substantial room for improvement in the code.  If you find an area for improvement please submit it as a pull request.  I am more than happy to continue learning better ways of utilizing both AngularJS and Rails.
